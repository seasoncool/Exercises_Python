#如何使用注释和井号

#A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
#Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

#You can also sue a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
#print "This won't run."

print "This will run."
